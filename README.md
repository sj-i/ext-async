# Async Extension for PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/concurrent-php/ext-async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/concurrent-php/ext-async)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/concurrent-php/ext-async/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/concurrent-php/ext-async)

Provides concurrent Zend VM executions using native C fibers in PHP.

## Async API

The async extension exposes a public API that can be used to create, run and interact with fiber-based async executions. You can obtain the API stub files for code completion in your IDE by installing `concurrent-php/async-api` via Composer.

### Awaitable

This interface cannot be implemented directly by userland classes, implementations are provided by `Deferred::awaitable()` and `Task`. `Awaitable` is exposed as a union type to enable proper type hinting.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

interface Awaitable { }
```

### Deferred

A deferred is a placeholder for an async operation that can be succeeded or failed from userland. It can be used to implement combinator function that operate on multiple `Awaitable` and expose a single `Awaitable` as result. The value returned from `awaitable()` is meant to be consumed by other tasks (or deferreds). The `Deferred` object itself must be kept private to the async operation because it can eighter succeed or fail the awaitable.

Each `Deferred` may specify a cancellation callback as constructor argument. The callback will be triggered when the current `Context` is cancelled. It receives the `Deferred` object as first argument and the cancellation error as second argument. You must not throw an error from the callback, doing so will trigger a fatal error and terminate the script.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Deferred
{
    public function __construct(callable $cancel = null) { }
    
    public function awaitable(): Awaitable { }
    
    public function resolve($val = null): void { }
    
    public function fail(\Throwable $e): void { }
    
    public static function value($val = null): Awaitable { }
    
    public static function error(\Throwable $e): Awaitable { }
    
    public static function combine(array $awaitables, callable $continuation): Awaitable { }
    
    public static function transform(Awaitable $awaitable, callable $transform): Awaitable { }
}
```

### Task

A task is a fiber-based object that executes a PHP function or method on a separate call stack. Tasks are created using `Task::async()` or `TaskScheduler::run()` (and there contextual counterparts). All tasks are associated with a task scheduler as they are created, there is no way to migrate tasks between different schedulers.

Calling `Task::await()` will suspend the current task and await resolution of the given `Awaitable`. If the awaited object is another `Task` it has to be run on the same scheduler, otherwise `await()` will throw an error.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Task implements Awaitable
{   
    public static function isRunning(): bool { }
    
    /* Should be replaced with async keyword if merged into PHP core. */
    public static function async(callable $callback, ...$args): Task { }
    
    /* Should be replaced with extended async keyword expression if merged into PHP core. */
    public static function asyncWithContext(Context $context, callable $callback, ...$args): Task { }
    
    /* Should be replaced with await keyword if merged into PHP core. */
    public static function await(Awaitable $awaitable): mixed { }
}
```

### TaskScheduler

The task scheduler manages a queue of ready-to-run tasks and a (shared) event loop that provides support for timers and async IO. It will also keep track of suspended tasks to allow for proper cleanup on shutdown. There is an implicit default scheduler that will be used when `Task::async()` or `Task::asyncWithContext()` is used in PHP code that is not run using one of the public scheduler methods. It is neighter necessary (nor advisable) to create a task scheduler instance yourself. The only exception to that rule are unit tests, each test should use a dedicated task scheduler to ensure proper test isolation.

You can use `run()` or `runWithContext()` to have the given callback be executed as root task within an isolated task scheduler. The run methods will return the value returned from your task callback or throw an error if your task callback throws. The scheduler will allways run all scheduled tasks to completion, even if the callback task you passed is completed before other tasks. The optional inspection callback will be called as soon as the root task (= the callback) is completed and receive an array containing information about all tasks that have not been completed yet.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class TaskScheduler
{
    public static function run(callable $callback, ?callable $inspect = null): mixed { }
    
    public static function runWithContext(Context $context, callable $callback, ?callable $inspect = null): mixed { }
}
```

### Context

Each async operation is associated with a `Context` object that provides a logical execution context. The context can be used to carry execution-specific variables and (in a later revision) cancellation signals across API boundaries. The context is immutable, a new context must be derived whenever anything needs to be changed for the current execution. You can pass a `Context` to `Task::asyncWithContext()` or `TaskScheduler::runWithContext()` that will become the current context for the new task. It is also possible to enable a context for the duration of a callback execution using the `run()` method. Every call to `Task::await()` will backup the current context and restore it when the task is resumed.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Context
{
    public function isBackground(): bool { }
    
    public function with(ContextVar $var, $value): Context { }
    
    public function withTimeout(int $milliseconds): Context { }
    
    public function shield(): Context { }
    
    public function token(): CancellationToken { }
    
    public function background(): Context { }
    
    public function run(callable $callback, ...$args): mixed { }
    
    public static function current(): Context { }
}
```

### ContextVar

You can access contextual data using a `ContextVar` object. Calling `get()` will lookup the variable's value from the context (passed as argument, current context by default). You have to use `Context::with()` to derive a new `Context` that has a value bound to the variable.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class ContextVar
{
    public function get(?Context $context = null) { }
}
```

### CancellationHandler

You can use a `CancellationHandler` to inherit a cancellable `Context` from any context. The cancellation handler uses the context passed to the constructor (or the current context when no context is passed) and provides a derived context with cancellation handling via `context()`. A call to `cancel()` will cancel the provided context, the optional error argument will registered as previous error with the cancellation exception.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class CancellationHandler
{
    public function __construct(?Context $context = null) { }
    
    public function context(): Context { }
    
    public function cancel(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
}
```

### CancellationToken

You can grab a `CancellationToken` from a `Context` to check if the context has been cancelled. This is useful in combination with `Context::shield()` to perform cancellation checks at specific times (a shielded context is not part of transitive cancellation, that is it will not be cancelled if the parent context is cancelled).

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class CancellationToken
{
    public function isCancelled(): bool { }
    
    public function throwIfCancelled(): void { }
}
```

## Watcher API

### Timer

The `Timer` class is used to schedule timers with the integrated event loop. Timers do not make use of callbacks, instead they will suspend the current task during `awaitTimeout()` and continue when the next timeout is exceeded. The first call to `awaitTimeout()` will start the timer. If additional tasks await an active the timer they will share the same timeout (which could be less than the value passed to the constructor). A `Timer` can be closed by calling `close()` which will fail all pending timeout subscriptions and prevent any further operations.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Timer
{
    public function __construct(int $milliseconds) { }
    
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
    
    public function awaitTimeout(): void { }
}
```

### StreamWatcher

A `StreamWatcher` observes a PHP stream or socket for readability or writability. Only a single stream watcher is allowed for any PHP resource. The watcher should be closed when it is no longer needed to free internal resources. The `StreamWatcher` will suspend the current task during `awaitReadable()` and `awaitWritable()` and continue once the watched stream becomes readable or is closed by the remote peer. A `StreamWatcher` can be used simultaneously (by multiple tasks) to await both read and write events, all tasks will be continued (in the same order as they entered await) once the stream is readable / writable. A `StreamWatcher` can be closed by calling `close()` which will fail all pending read & write subscriptions and prevent any further operations.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Watcher
{
    public function __construct($resource) { }
    
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
    
    public function awaitReadable(): void { }
    
    public function awaitWritable(): void { }
}
```

### SignalWatcher

A `SignalWatcher` observes UNIX signals (limited support on Windows). The watcher should be closed when it is no longer needed to free internal resources. The current task will be suspended during calls to `awaitSignal()` and continue once the signal has been received. Multiple tasks can await a signal at the same time, all of them will be continued when the signal has been received. You can use `isSupported()` to check if the passed signal can be observed. Windows systems only support `SIGHUP` (console window closed) and `SIGINT` (CTRL + C) handling.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class SignalWatcher
{
    public const SIGHUP;
    public const SIGINT;
    public const SIGQUIT;
    public const SIGKILL;
    public const SIGTERM;
    public const SIGUSR1;
    public const SIGUSR2;

    public function __construct(int $signum) { }
    
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
    
    public function awaitSignal(): void { }
    
    public static function isSupported(int $signum): bool { }
}
```

## Stream API

The stream API provides an object-oriented interface to arbitrary byte streams. The stream API is closely aligned with `fclose()`, `fread()` and `fwrite()` functions.

### ReadableStream

A readable stream provides access to chunks of incoming data. There is no method to check for EOF, a call to `read()` will return `null` when the stream is at EOF. The (optional) `$length` argument can be used to specify the maximum number of bytes to be returned, a stream might return fewer bytes depending on network IO or internal buffers. Every call to `read()` must return at least one bytes, or `null` if no more bytes can be read (EOF). The optional error argument of `close()` allows to pass in an error that will be set as previous error when failing a read operation. Calling `close()` will fail all pending read operations and prevent any further reads from the stream by throwing a `StreamClosedException`.

Only one pending read operation is allowed on a `ReadableStream` at any time. Calls to `read()` must throw a `PendingReadException` if an attempt is made to read from a stream before all previous reads have completed.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Stream;

interface ReadableStream
{
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void;
    
    public function read(?int $length = null): ?string;
}
```

### WritableStream

A writable stream allows to write chunks of data in sequence. Multiple calls to `write()` from different tasks at the same time are allowed, stream implementations must preserve order of write operations. The optional error argument of `close()` allows to pass in an error that will be set as previous error when failing a write operation. Calling `close()` will fail all pending write operations and prevent any further writes from the stream.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Stream;

interface WritableStream
{
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void;
    
    public function write(string $data): void;
}
```

### DuplexStream

The duplex stream implements both `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream`. Streams backed by a socket will usually be compatible with (and implement) this interface. You can call `readStream()` or `writeStream()` to aquire a stream that is restricted to one of the combined interfaces. This is especially useful if you want calls to `close()` to result in a half-closed stream.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Stream;

interface DuplexStream extends ReadableStream, WritableStream
{
    public function readStream(): ReadableStream;
    
    public function writeStream(): WritableStream;
}
```

## Network API

The network API provides access to stream and datagram sockets.

### TcpSocket

A `TcpSocket` wraps a TCP network conneciton. It implements `DuplexStream` to provide access based on the stream API. Closing a TCP socket will close both read and write sides of the stream. You can use `writeStream()` to aquire the writer and call `close()` on it to signal the remote peer that the stream is half-closed, you can still read data from the remote peer until the stream is closed by the remote peer.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Network;

use Concurrent\Stream\DuplexStream
use Concurrent\Stream\ReadableStream
use Concurrent\Stream\WritableStream

final class TcpSocket implements DuplexStream
{
    public static function connect(string $host, int $port, ?ClientEncryption $encryption = null): Socket { }
    
    public static function pair(): array { }
    
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
    
    public function nodelay(bool $enable): void { }
    
    public function getLocalPeer(): array { }
    
    public function getRemotePeer(): array { }
    
    public function encrypt(): void { }
    
    public function read(?int $length = null): ?string { }
    
    public function readStream(): ReadableStream { }
    
    public function write(string $data): void { }
    
    public function writeStream(): WritableStream { }
}
```

### TcpServer

A `TcpServer` listens on a local port for incoming TCP connection attempts until `close()` is called to terminate the server socket. You have to call `accept()` to accept the next pending connection attempt. Each accepted connection is wrapped in a `TcpSocket` that can be used to communicate with the remote peer. Accepted socket connections are not closed when the server is closed, they have to be closed individually by calling `close()` on the `TcpSocket` object.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Network;

final class TcpServer
{
    public static function listen(string $host, int $port, ?ServerEncryption $encryption = null): Server { }
    
    public function close(?\Throwable $e = null): void { }
    
    public function getHost(): string { }
    
    public function getPort(): int { }
    
    public function getPeer(): array { }
    
    public function accept(): Socket { }
}
```

### ClientEncryption

Configures an encrypted (TLS) socket client.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Network;

final class ClientEncryption
{
    public function withAllowSelfSigned(bool $allow): self { }
    
    public function withPeerName(string $name): self { }
}
```

### ServerEncryption

Configures an encrypted (TLS) socket server.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Network;

final class ServerEncryption
{
    public function withDefaultCertificate(string $cert, string $key, ?string $passphrase = null): self { }
}
```

## Process API

The process API provides tools to spawn processes and communicate with them. This includes setting the work directory, setting environment variables, dealing with input / output, support for signals (limited support on Windows) and awaiting termination (including access to the exit code).

### ProcessBuilder

The `ProcessBuilder` is used to configure the execution environment of a spawned process. The constructor takes the command to be executed, additional arguments can be passed to `execute()` or `start()`. The current working directory of the spawned process can be changed using `setDirectory()`, the process will inherit the current working directory by default. You can specify env vars to be passed to the process using `setEnv()`, inheritance of all current env vars can be configured using `inheritEnv()` (inheritance is enabled by default, variables specified in `setEnv()` will be added to the inherited vars).

Each process is spawned with access to three anonymous pipes (`STDIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR`). The behavior of these pipes can be configured using the `configure*($mode, $fd)` methods of the `ProcessBuilder`. By default all pipes will be ignored (redirected to eighter `/dev/null` or `NUL`) providing no access to process IO. It is possible to have pipes use the same pipe as the process that is spawning a new process, use `STDIO_INHERIT` as `$mode` and one of the `ProcessBuilder` class constants (`STDIN`, `STDOUT` and `STDERR`) to configure inheritance. Both `STDIO_IGNORE` and `STDIO_INHERIT` handle IO automatically, there is no way to control or access the pipes. If you need to write or read data to / from a pipe you need to configure it using `STDIO_PIPE` as mode. Doing so will provide access to the various pipes as async streams that can be accessed using the `Process` object.

A call to `execute()` will run the spawned process to completion and return with the exit code of the process. This method can only be used if all pipes are configured with mode `STDIO_IGNORE` or `STDIO_INHERIT`. If you need to do pipe IO, access the process PID or signal the process you need to call `start()` instead which will return a `Process` object that provides access to a running process.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Process;

final class ProcessBuilder
{
    public const STDIN;
    public const STDOUT;
    public const STDERR;
    
    public const STDIO_IGNORE;
    public const STDIO_INHERIT;
    public const STDIO_PIPE;
    
    public function __construct(string $command, string ...$args) { }
    
    public function setDirectory(string $dir): void { }
    
    public function setEnv(array $env): void { }
    
    public function inheritEnv(bool $inherit): void { }
    
    public function configureStdin(int $mode, ?int $fd = null): void { }
    
    public function configureStdout(int $mode, ?int $fd = null): void { }
    
    public function configureStderr(int $mode, ?int $fd = null): void { }
    
    public function execute(string ...$args): int {}
    
    public function start(string ...$args): Process {}
}
```

### Process

The `Process` class provides access to a started process. You can use `isRunning()` to check if the process has terminated yet. The process identifier can be accessed using `getPid()`. Iy any pipe was configured using `STDIO_PIPE` it will be accessible via the corresponding getter method. You can send a signal to the process using `signal()`, on Windows systems only `SIGHUP` and `SIGINT` are supported (you should use the class constants defined in `SignalWatcher` to avoid magic numbers). Calling `awaitExit()` will suspend the current task until the process has terminated and return the exit code of the process.

```php
namespace Concurrent\Process;

use Concurrent\Stream\ReadableStream;
use Concurrent\Stream\WritableStream;

final class Process
{
    public function isRunning(): bool { }
    
    public function getPid(): int { }
    
    public function getStdin(): WritableStream { }
    
    public function getStdout(): ReadableStream { }
    
    public function getStderr(): ReadableStream { }
    
    public function signal(int $signum): void { }
    
    public function awaitExit(): int { }
}
```

## Functions

An async version of `gethostbyname()` is provided to allow non-blocking DNS name resolution. This requires PHP to be run via `cli` or `phpdbg` SAPI, any other API will fallback to synchronous resolution for now (the function can still be used in these cases, but it will block until the name is resolved).

```php
namespace Concurrent;

function gethostbyname(string $host): string { }
```

## Fiber

A lower-level API for concurrent callback execution is available through the `Fiber` API. The underlying stack-switching is the same as in the `Task` implementation but fibers do not come with a scheduler or a higher level abstraction of continuations. A fiber must be started and resumed by the caller in PHP userland. Calling `Fiber::yield()` will suspend the fiber and return the yielded value to `start()`, `resume()` or `throw()`. The `status()` method is needed to check if the fiber has been run to completion yet.

```php
namespace Concurrent;

final class Fiber
{
    public const STATUS_INIT;
    public const STATUS_SUSPENDED;
    public const STATUS_RUNNING;
    public const STATUS_FINISHED;
    public const STATUS_FAILED;
    
    public function __construct(callable $callback, ?int $stack_size = null) { }
    
    public function status(): int { }
    
    public function start(...$args): mixed { }
    
    public function resume($val = null): mixed { }
    
    public function throw(\Throwable $e): mixed { }
    
    public static function isRunning(): bool { }
    
    public static function backend(): string { }
    
    public static function yield($val = null): mixed { }
}
```

## Async / Await Keyword Transformation

The extension provides `Task::async()` and `Task::await()` static methods that are implemented in a way that allows for a very simple transformation to the keywords `async` and `await` which could be introduced into PHP some time in the future.

```php
$task = async $this->sendRequest($request, $timeout);
$response = await $task;

// The above code would be equivalent to the following:
$task = Task::async(Closure::fromCallable($this, 'sendRequest'), $request, $timeout);
$response = Task::await($task);
```

The example shows a possible syntax for a keyword-based async execution model. The `async` keyword can be prepended to any function or method call to create a `Task` object instead of executing the call directly. The calling scope should be preserved by this operation, hence being consistent with the way method calls work in PHP (no need to create a closure in userland code). The `await` keyword is equivalent to calling `Task::await()` but does not require a function call, it can be implemented as an opcode handler in the Zend VM.

```php
$context = Context::inherit(['foo' => 'bar']);

$task = async $context => doSomething($a, $b);
$result = await $task;

// The above code would be equivalent to the following:
$task = Task::asyncWithContext($context, 'doSomething', [$a, $b]);
$result = Task::await($task);
```

The second example shows how passing a new context to a task would also be possible using the `async` keyword. This would allow for a very simple and readable way to setup tasks in a specific context using a keyword-based syntax.

### PHP with support for async & await keywords

You can install a patched version of PHP that provides native support for `async` and `await` as described in the transformation section. To get up and running with it you can execute this in your shell:

```shell
mkdir php-src
curl -LSs https://github.com/concurrent-php/php-src/archive/async.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C "php-src" --strip-components 1

pushd php-src
./buildconf --force
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/php/cli --with-config-file-path=/usr/local/php/cli --without-pear
make -j4
make install
popd

mkdir ext-async
curl -LSs https://github.com/concurrent-php/ext-async/archive/master.tar.gz | sudo tar -xz -C "ext-async" --strip-components 1

pushd ext-async
phpize
./configure
make install
popd
```

This will install a modified version of PHP's master branch that has full support for `async` and `await`. It will also install the `async` extension that is required for the actual async execution model.

### Source Transformation Examples

The source transformation needs to consider namespaces and preserve scope. Dealing with namespaces is a problem when it comes to function calls because there is a fallback to the global namespace involved and there is no way to determine the called function in all cases during compilation. Here are some examples of code using `async` / `await` syntax and the transformed source code:

```php
$task = async max(1, 2, 3);
$result = await $task;

$task = \Concurrent\Task::async('max', 1, 2, 3);
$result = \Concurrent\Task::await($task);
``` 
Function calls in global namespace only have to check imported functions, the correct function can be determined at compile time.

```php
namespace Foo;

$task = async bar(1, 2);

$task = \Concurrent\Task::async(\function_exists('Foo\\bar') ? 'Foo\\bar' : 'bar', 1, 2);
```
Unqualified function calls in namespace require runtime evaluation of the function to be called (unless the function is imported via use statement).

```php
namespace Foo;

$context = \Concurrent\Context::inherit(['num' => 321]);
$work = function (int $a): int { return $a + Context::var('num'); };

$result = await async $context => $work(42);

$result = \Concurrent\Task::await(\Concurrent\Task::asyncWithContext(\Closure::fromCallable($work), 42));
```
Calling functions stored in variables requires to keep track of the calling scope because `$work` might contain a method call (or an object with `__invoke()` method) with a visibility other than `public`.
